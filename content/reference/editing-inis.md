Some mods include an MCM, but many others keep their settings in a plain-text {{< file file-lines >}}.ini{{< /file >}} file: {{< nexus 164902 >}}SpellBender VR{{< /nexus >}}, {{< nexus 119689 >}}Spell Auto-Aim VR{{< /nexus >}}, PLANCK, and more. An INI is just a list of `key=value` settings grouped under bracketed `[Sections]`. You can edit one right inside MO2, or in a text editor of your choice.

## Edit in MO2...

For a quick change, you don't need to leave Mod Organizer. Double-click the mod in the left pane (or right-click it and choose {{< btn-inline >}}Information...{{< /btn-inline >}}) to open its information window, then switch to the {{< btn-inline >}}INI Files{{< /btn-inline >}} tab. Any INI files the mod ships with are listed on the left; click one to edit it on the right.

{{< aside type="alert" title="Save before you close" >}}
The INI editor has its own save button, and your edits _aren't_ saved automatically. Click {{< btn-inline "floppy-disk" >}}Save{{< /btn-inline >}} (or press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd>) before you close the window, or your change won't stick.
{{< /aside >}}

This is the fastest way to flip a setting or two. For anything bigger, the built-in editor gets cramped, and you'll be happier in a proper text editor.

## ...or in a text editor

Because of MO2's [Virtual File System](/reference/overwrite), a managed mod's files aren't actually sitting in your Skyrim VR game folder, so don't go looking for them there. Open the mod's own folder instead:

1. Find the mod in the left pane of MO2.
2. Right-click it and choose {{< btn-inline >}}Open in Explorer{{< /btn-inline >}}.
3. Locate the {{< file file-lines >}}.ini{{< /file >}} file. It's often in the root of the mod folder, or under {{< file folder-open >}}SKSE\Plugins{{< /file >}} for SKSE plugins.
4. Open it in a text editor, make your changes, and save.
5. Launch the game as usual, and the new settings take effect.

Windows Notepad is fine (far better than it used to be), but something like Notepad++ makes INIs easier to work with. Just don't open an INI in a word processor like Word, which can butcher the formatting.

## Changing a setting

Inside, you'll see lines like this:

```ini
[Settings]
EnableSomeFeature = 0
```

Many settings are a simple toggle between `0` (off) or `1` (on), so flipping a feature on is often just a matter of changing a `0` to a `1`. Only change the value to the right of the `=`, and leave the setting name and the section headers alone. If you're lucky, an INI will include comments (lines starting with `;`) explaining what each setting does, so read those before you change anything.

{{< aside type="btw" title="Back it up" >}}
Before you change a value, it's a good idea to backup the file. If the change doesn't work out, you can put it back exactly as it was.

If a mod rewrites its own INI while the game is running, a new copy can land in the [Overwrite](/reference/overwrite) folder. If you made an edit and it seems to have reverted, check there.

## Skyrim's INIs

Skyrim VR's own INIs, ({{< file file-lines >}}skyrimvr.ini{{< /file >}} and {{< file file-lines >}}skyrimprefs.ini{{< /file >}}), aren't mod files. MO2 manages them per profile, so edit them through MO2's built-in {{< btn-inline >}}INI Editor{{< /btn-inline >}} tool rather than poking at files on disk. To open it, select {{< btn-inline >}}INI Editor{{< /btn-inline >}} from the run dropdown near the upper-right (the dropdown that usually has {{< btn-inline >}}Launch MGO{{< /btn-inline >}} selected) and click {{< btn-inline play >}}Run{{< /btn-inline >}}. MGO already has these tuned, so you shouldn't need to touch them unless you really know what you're doing.
